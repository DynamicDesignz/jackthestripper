JackTheStripper
---------------
- Man in the middle automated attacks -
This project aims to perform MITM attacks in automated way.

JackTheStripper arises as a personal project from Lucas (also known as Cascudo). 
The project was made just for fun and for learning reasons, however the #lampiaosec
(group that the author [Cascudo] is a member) decided to embrace the Jack as a first 
step of the group, that way, the project starts to be part of lampiaosec's projects.
